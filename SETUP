To setup talkie, you'll need to upload these files to some sort of server with the ruby
binaries available, and run 'rackup' in the talkie folder. You can use other server's
with rack support like thin, but just be sure you make sure whatever you use allows
plenty of concurrent connections, and has some threading support! You'll also need to alter
the file permissions for both the 'users' and 'rooms' folders to ensure the ruby scripts
can read, write, create, and delete things within. Finally, you'll want to alter the
'xrds.xml' file to correctly represent the location you are hosting talkie at on the web.

xrds can be sorted out later on however, as it simply makes the UI of openid providers,
such as Yahoo OpenID, less scary to your users.

Talkie was originally a cgi application, and hasn't changed much from that. If you ignore
the botrunner support, you could run it as a cgi ruby script with only minimal changes.
Depending on how fast your server is, this might be a very good option. :)

Oh, and one more thing! Check out the helpers.rb file. My openid's are hacked in there
in the user_owns_room? method, change them out for your own or i'll be able to login
and have ownership rights over rooms everywhere in your system! Mwa ha ha ha ha ha... :)

And another thing! In config.ru, there's some code which is specific to the DreamHost
hosting talkie.me currently is running on, ditch it or change it as needed!

Hope you love talkie!
