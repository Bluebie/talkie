To setup talkie, you'll need to upload these files to some sort of server with the ruby
binaries available, and enable 'cgi' support for the .rb files. You'll also need to alter
the file permissions for both the 'users' and 'rooms' folders to ensure the ruby scripts
can read, write, create, and delete things within. Finally, you'll want to alter the
'xrds.xml' file to correctly represent the location you are hosting talkie at on the web.

xrds can be sorted out later on however, as it simply makes the UI of openid providers,
such as Yahoo OpenID, less scary to your users.
